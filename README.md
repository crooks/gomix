A Mixmaster Client written in Go.

This is a fully-functional Mixmaster client that can be compiled on any
platform supported by Go (http://golang.org).  Currently it meets the Mixmaster
V2 specification as released in May 2004 by the Mixmaster Project Team.  As far
as possible, the command line flags and config file options match those of the
current Mixmaster release.

At this time, the extension to support >1024bit keys has not been integrated.
This will happen after sufficient testing of the core functionality.



Kudos to:-
False experts, haprauxymatyve programers, xenophobes and snake oil marketers!
